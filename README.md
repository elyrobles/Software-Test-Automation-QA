# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I work section by section. In this course I created a contact class that created new contacts for an application, these contacts could only be added with a unique contact ID, a first and last name with specific lengths, a phone string being exactly 10 characters and an address field with a 30 character limit. ALl of these strings could not be left empty either by the user. After creating this class I immediately got to work on the contact test java file in the test package. I tested to make sure all the requirements were met in the contact class then ran the JUnit test to make sure all areas were covered and to ensure a high percentage of coverage. I then repeated this step for the contact service class and contact service test file. A secure application starts with well-written, bugfree code.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
After reviewing the requirements and identifying user needs, I firstly like to take a step back and understand who our client is and what they want their system to do overall as well as the constraints that we could possibly face. If possible, gathering as much requiremnts as I can through interviews with stakeholders and reviewing their company documents will help me come to a better understanding of how the system should work. After gathering this information, I can then incorporate them into the program. 

# How do I approach designing software?
I like to appraoch designing software by following the sofware development lifecylce; gathering as much requirements as possible, specifying how the system should work, designing, implementing, unit testing, and maintenance.
